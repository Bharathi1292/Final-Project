Risk Analysis
1. Data Quality Risks
•	Risk: Missing or inconsistent data in the Super Store dataset could lead to inaccurate insights.
•	Likelihood: Medium
•	Impact: High
•	Mitigation:
     o	Performed data cleaning in Databricks using PySpark.
     o	Removed duplicate records and handled missing values by replacing them with appropriate statistical measures (e.g., mean or mode).


2. Technical Risks
•	Risk: Challenges in using Databricks Community Edition, including session timeouts and limited memory.
•	Likelihood: High
•	Impact: Medium
•	Mitigation:
     o	Saved progress frequently to prevent data loss due to session timeouts.
     o	Optimized the dataset by working with a smaller sample for testing before scaling up.
  


3. Analysis Risks
•	Risk: Misinterpreting trends or creating unclear visualizations.
•	Likelihood: Medium
•	Impact: High
•	Mitigation:
     o	Cross-checked results with raw data to ensure accuracy.
     o	Created multiple visualizations (e.g., bar charts for sales categories, line charts for trends) to verify insights were consistent.

 

4. Time Management Risks
•	Risk: Limited time for completing cleaning, transformation, analysis, and documentation.
•	Likelihood: High
•	Impact: High
•	Mitigation:
     o	Created a week-by-week timeline for tasks and tracked progress.
     o	Focused on completing high-priority sections (data cleaning and visualizations) before moving to optional features.
