    Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Superstore Sales dataset and uncover insights such as:
    Sales trends over time.
    Top-performing regions and product categories.
    Sales distribution by customer segment.
    Profit margins and their relationship with sales.
    Sales performance by shipping mode.
    The analysis involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python and tools like Databricks.

Technologies Used
     Databricks Community Edition: For data processing, transformation, and analysis.
     Apache Spark: For distributed data processing.
     Python: For data manipulation and analysis (via PySpark).
     SQL: For querying the data within Databricks.
     GitHub: For version control and project management.

Dataset
  The dataset used in this project is from Kaggleâ€™s Superstore Sales. Key columns include:

   Order Information: Order ID, Date, Shipping Date, Mode, etc.
   Customer Information: Customer ID, Name, Segment, Location, etc.
   Product Details: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, and Name.
   Sales Data: Sales amount, Profit, and Discount.
   Geography: Region, State, City, Postal Code.

Risk Analysis
   This section identifies potential risks faced during the project, assesses their impact, and describes mitigation strategies.

1. Data Quality Risks
    Risk: Missing or inconsistent data could lead to inaccurate insights.
    Likelihood: Medium
    Impact: High
    Mitigation:
         Applied data cleaning techniques in Databricks to handle missing values (e.g., replacing null values with averages) and removed duplicates.

2. Technical Risks
    Risk: Databricks Community Edition limitations, such as session timeouts or memory constraints.
    Likelihood: High
    Impact: Medium
    Mitigation:
        Saved progress frequently and optimized data processing workflows by using smaller samples during testing.

3. Time Constraints
    Risk: Limited time for completing all phases of the project.
    Likelihood: High
    Impact: High
    Mitigation:
          Created a task timeline and prioritized key steps like data cleaning and visualization.

4. Visualization Risks
    Risk: Difficulty creating effective visualizations to convey insights.
    Likelihood: Medium
    Impact: Medium
    Mitigation:
          Used multiple types of visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) and validated their accuracy against raw data.

5. Documentation Risks
     Risk: Lack of adequate documentation for the project could hinder understanding or reproducibility.
     Likelihood: Medium
     Impact: Medium
     Mitigation:
                Maintained detailed README and tracked issues using GitHub.

Analysis and Insights

The following insights were uncovered during the analysis:

Sales by Region:
      Sales were highest in the West region, followed by East and Central.
Sales Trends Over Time:
      Sales increased during holiday seasons, showing a seasonal pattern.
Sales by Category:
      The Technology category consistently outperformed other categories in sales.
Profit and Sales Correlation:
      Certain categories, like Technology, had higher profit margins compared to others.
Sales Distribution by Customer Segment:
       The Consumer segment contributed the most to overall sales.

Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to better understand the data:

  Sales by Region: Bar chart visualizing total sales per region.
  Sales vs Profit: Scatter plot comparing sales and profit to identify profitable products.
  Sales Trend Over Time: Line chart showing sales trends over months and years.
  Top Products by Sales: Bar chart displaying the top 10 products by total sales.
  Sales by Ship Mode: Pie chart visualizing sales distribution across shipping modes.
